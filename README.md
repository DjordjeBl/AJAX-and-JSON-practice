# AJAX and JSON practice

JSON is an open-standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of name-value pairs. 
It is the most common data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication.

AJAX is a method of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page.
It uses a combination of:
 - A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
 - JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
